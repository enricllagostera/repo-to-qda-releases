# Repo to QDA releases

A repo to make public the released versions, to track bugs and discuss aspects of the **Repo to QDA** tool development.

## Summary

A tool to prepare game dev project repositories for analysis using QDA (qualitative data analysis) digital tools. Its main purpose is to facilitate qualitative methodologies being applied to game creation processes documented using the [MDM](https://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdm) approach. It takes a project repository URL from GitHub and processes it to create a structured project file in the REFI-QDA format (i.e. a QDPX file), ready to be imported into QDA tools (e.g. QualCoder, Atlas.ti, NVivo) for analysis.

This project is being developed by [Enric Granzotto Llagostera](https://enric.llagostera.com.br) as part of the [Games as Research](https://www.gamesasresearch.com/) project.

More detail on the project will be made available in the future.

## Installation

Requires [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to be installed and that it can be called using the command git.
